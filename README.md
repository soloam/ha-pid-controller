## What makes a PID Controller special
When coding a temperature controller for exemple, we like to set the max temperature and control the flow output or temperature output, based on the response from the temperature sensors.A PID Controller retrieves the response of the sensors and calculates the power output necessary to achieve the desired target or maintain it with small oscillations.
## Installation
### Install from HACS (recommended)
1. Have [HACS][hacs] installed, this will allow you to easily manage and track updates.
1. Search for "PID Controller".
1. Click Install below the found integration.
... then if you want to use `configuration.yaml` to configure the sensor...
1. Add `pid_controller` sensor to your `configuration.yaml` file. See configuration examples below.
1. Restart Home Assistant
### Manual installation
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. Download the content from the custom_components to that folder
... then if you want to use `configuration.yaml` to configure sensor...
1. Add `pid_controller` sensor to your `configuration.yaml` file. See configuration examples below.
1. Restart Home Assistant
### Configuration Examples

# Basic Calibration of a PID
For this I'm gonna use a practical example on calibrating the PID to be used as a thermostat to a climate system. Warming a room
The PID is calibrated using the p|i|d variables.

 For start:

- Set all to zero. It helps to have this as an input_number.
- Set target temperature (set_point). It helps to have this as an input_number.
- Set minimum to 0 (for now). It helps to have this as an input_number.
- Set maximum to 1 (for now). It helps to have this as an input_number.
- Set the entity_id to a sensor that reports the temperature of the room


### Get the base 
Setting all p|i|d variables to zero, the pid will behave as a normal on/off thermostat, siting to the max value when below the target temperature, and to the min value when above.
Start the climate, the room should start warming up, and the PID should start receiving feedback from the sensor. When the temperature is below the target the PID should return 1 (target this to turn on your climate), when above the target it should return 0 (target this to turn off your climate). You should see something like this:

![PID Phase 1][pid_phase1]

The blue line is cycling around the target (25). From this we should take note of 2 important references:

- The peak temperature, in this case we will assume 30 aka overshoot
- The time that it took since it crossed the set point until it reached the peak, in this case we will assume 11 seconds.

### Setting the Proportional Band (p)
To set a p value we will start with double the overshoot, in this example 10 (5*2). This should pull down the reporting value from the PID, making a lower overshoot, and setteling bellow the set point

![PID Phase 2][pid_phase2]

We still can notice a bit of 'waving', but the overshoot is a lot smaller, and the other peaks start getting smaller, until barely noticeable.
### Setting the Integral Band (i)
To set the i value we will double the time of the overshoot of the first phase, in our example 22 (11*2). This will pull the values to the set point, but will add a bit of 'waving' (we will deal with this next). Lower values will result on a faster approatch to the target, at the cost of stability.

![PID Phase 3][pid_phase3]
### Setting the Derivate Band (d)
To reduce the waving and the overshoot we can add some Derivate, to calculate this we can set half the overshoot time measured in phase 1, in our case 5 (11/2). This is the result:

![PID Phase 4][pid_phase4]

### Controlling Waveup
The Integral part of the PID works by incrementing the error from the reading to increment the output. Sometime it can happen, if the error is too big that the incremental part scales the output way too far. To handle this you can set a maximum incremental value in the _windup_ value.
### Debugging the PID
You can look at the attributes of the sensor to the p|i|d variables, that should return the amount that each part is contributing to the PID output.
# Inverted PID
The PID standard behavior is to output the power that would be needed to raise the reported value to reach the set point. But if you need the inverted behavior, like a cooling system, that the rise of the output would lower the reported value, until it reaches the set point. To do this you can set _invert: yes_.
